# OOP_Refactoring
This project was to refactor a procedural game to an Object-Oriented Game. The game simply allows a player to find the winning position within the playing field and if the player leaves the field then they will lose the game.

Refer to the "1. Procedural Code" file to view the code before it being refactored.
Refer to the "2. Refactoring step 1-4" and "3. Refactoring steps 5-8" files to view the steps I took to make it OOP
